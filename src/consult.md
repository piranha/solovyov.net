Hey, my name is Alexander, and I've been working in IT for over 20 years in
various roles. For the last 8 years I've served as a CTO for
[Kasta](https://kasta.ua).

During my tenure, I successfully grew a team of 40 people and led them to become
the best technical team in our industry. We were able to pioneer new approaches
and technologies, and successfully rewrote our entire system from scratch,
migrating it to a new, modern architecture. Our team’s dedication and hard work
allowed us to achieve great success, and I am proud to have been a part of it.

Now that I'm not employed full-time, I believe that sharing my knowledge and
experience with other companies could benefit them. So I have decided to start
consulting.

          Alexander played a crucial role in advancing
          <a href="https://eva.ua">Eva.ua</a> technical capabilities. He
          conducted a thorough technical audit of the system and provided
          valuable recommendations. This helped us address several long-standing
          issues: we finally hired an in-house CTO, managed to kill overselling,
          cleaned up our database schema, improved site performance, greatly
          reduced deployment risk and time.

      <p>
        He’s the most knowledgeable person I know, understands technology and
        business, and is humble and willing to listen. It’s a rare combo. He
        helped to identify where we stuck in our development process and
        collaborated to design a course of action to solve them.
