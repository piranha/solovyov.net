That's just a test note for my blog with a cover image inside. For real, Iâ€™m just testing creating posts from Bear. 

Honestly, the worst part is adding configuration, that Drafts.app scripting is just amazing. If only author added some support for images I would not need to spend all that time on a Bear/Telegram/Github integration. :)

Anyway, isn't it pretty? :-)
