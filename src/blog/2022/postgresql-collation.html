<p>I&#39;ve got into a situation with PG I&#39;ve never been into before. There is a financial reports table, containing some description of a transaction, with columns like <code>date</code>, <code>amount</code> and <code>comment</code>. And this <code>comment</code> field is often used to search for something case-insensitively. This is done best using <code>where lower(comment) like &#39;%some words%&#39;</code> using trigram index:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">create index report_comment_lower_trgm on report 
  using gin (lower(comment) gin_trgm_ops);
</code></pre>

<p>But I&#39;ve been looking for one concrete thing and couldn&#39;t find, even though I knew it&#39;s there:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">finreport=# select count(*) from report where lower(comment) like &#39;%кредиторськ%&#39;;
 count 
-------
     0
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, it turns out that just looking for a case-sensitive version works just fine:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">finreport=# select count(*) from report where comment like &#39;%Кредиторськ%&#39;;
 count 
-------
    40
</code></pre>

<p>What is even going on? After reading some articles, it seems like the main reason for this is an incorrect collation, so I went to check:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">finreport=# select datcollate, datctype from pg_database where datname = &#39;asd&#39;;
 datcollate | datctype 
------------+----------
 C          | C
</code></pre>

<p>Wow, well, obviously <code>C</code> is not very correct when I&#39;m looking at Ukrainian. Okay, is there a way to update collation? Some answers on Stack Overflow propose to just update <code>pg_database</code>, which is immediately did. Any guesses what happens next?</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">finreport=# select count(*) from report where lower(comment) like &#39;%кредиторська%&#39;;
 count 
-------
    11

finreport=# select count(*) from report where lower(comment) like &#39;%кредиторська%&#39;;
 count 
-------
     3

finreport=# select count(*) from report where lower(comment) like &#39;%кредиторська%&#39;;
 count 
-------
     7
</code></pre>

<p>I had not expected <strong>this</strong>! Well, I did all the things you do when things are going wrong: re-created index, analyzed table, restarted the database — and the last one finally changed something! It started giving me 0 rows back again. :)</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Recreate database anew, so just dump and restore:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># stop all the things which can change db here
$ pg_dump finreport &gt; finreport.dump
# Postgres complained about &quot;template&quot; having other collation
# and proposed using &quot;template0&quot;. I have no idea what&#39;s the
# difference, but it worked.
$ createdb -l uk_UA.UTF-8 -E utf-8 --template=template0 qwe
$ psql qwe -f finreport.dump

# renaming databases
$ psql postgres -c &quot;select pg_terminate_backend(pid) from pg_stat_activity where datname = &#39;finreport&#39;&quot;
$ psql postgres -c &quot;alter database finreport rename to asd&quot;
$ psql postgres -c &quot;alter database qwe rename to finreport&quot;
# don&#39;t forget to start all the stuff here and drop asd
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously resets everything, and it now works as intended.</p>

<p>I&#39;m uncertain if various UTF-8 collations will be different. I hope not because in other case I have no idea how to deal with multiple languages in a single Postgres db.</p>
