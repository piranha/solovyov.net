My name is Alexander Solovyov. I'm a software engineer - though I took part
in all aspects of development, started my career as a Linux admin and then
progressed to a CTO for a team of ~40 people, and then a Chief Product Officer
as well. Tech-wise, my career was Python, then JavaScript, then Clojure.

I've spent most of my career at start-ups or companies close to being to
start-up. I've been an early adopter of Django framework (early 2007
professionally), React (we started building an app in React just 3 months after
release), and then converted a whole company to Clojure (for efficiency - and it
paid off and continues to do so).

I've been an active member of Ukrainian's Python, JavaScript and Clojure
communities. One reason I've become known to a wider audience was a talk
I gave about FRP, JavaScript and ClojureScript called [Coding UI
painlessly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4mmMsAVjzk). My frustrations with
building UIs in Backbone.js led me to search for a greener pasture. Weirdly
enough, that talk happened just 3 months before the release of React, which solved
most of my pain points.

Channels I maintain are Twitter [@asolovyov](https://twitter.com/asolovyov),
Telegram [Bite the Byte](https://t.me/bitethebyte) and 
a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@asolovyov).

Outside of work, I'm a father to a son and a daughter, and they are a constant
source of delight and frustration alike. :)

If you want to contact me, use my email, it's `alexander@<this-domain>`.
