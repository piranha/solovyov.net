Hey, my name is Alexander Solovyov. Most of my professional journey is tracked
on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asolovyov/).

I've spent most of my career at start-ups or companies close to being to
start-up. I've been an early adopter of Django framework (early 2007
professionally), React (we started building an app in React just 3 months after
release), and then converted a whole company to Clojure (for efficiency and
effectiveness - it paid off and continues to do so).

Right now most visible things I'm doing are (both in Ukrainian) Telegram channel
[Bite the Byte](https://t.me/bitethebyte) and a podcast on Youtube called [1-2-3
Techno](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwj_3ikgO3CLGGQ_xuXv8DG1upc_ih8SG).

I'm also [consulting](/consult/), so email me if you're interested.

<p>If you want to contact me, use my email: <script type="text/javascript">document.write("<n uers=\"znvygb:nyrknaqre\100fbybilbi\056arg\">nyrknaqre\100fbybilbi\056arg<\057n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g,function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));</script></p>
