Who I am    </h1>

    <h2>
Alexander Solovyov    </h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Paylogic employee</li>
<li>Python developer for 5 years</li>
<li>Mercurial contributor for 3 years</li>
<li>...and author and contributor to several other projects</li>
</ul>
<!-- during my career I participated in quite high amount of different projects -->
<!-- and had exposure to significant amount of different workflows so I'd like to -->
<!-- share with you some thoughts on what I think is one of nicest workflows -->
  </section>

<section class="slide">
<hgroup>
    <h1>
Traditional workflow    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Everybody has write access to central repository</li>
<li>Code review post factum</li>
<li>Centralized VCS, linear history</li>
</ul>
<!-- Here we have a workflow used by thousands of companies in the world. It's -->
<!-- quite easy to understand, quite natural to start with and overall it's still -->
<!-- not that bad if you can imagine working without version control at all. This -->
<!-- is typical to work like that when you have subversion. -->
<!-- Sometimes it works like that even if you're migrated to something better. -->
  </section>

<section class="slide">
<hgroup>
    <h1>
What's wrong    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Too much conflicts</li>
</ul>
<!-- stops working for bigger amount of people... -->
<ul class="simple">
<li>Post factum never works</li>
</ul>
<!-- or you want better quality control -->
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unfinished work hard to manage</li>
</ul>
<!-- But it obviously has problems. When a developer works on some problem, it's -->
<!-- natural to commit to save some intermediate state. And when your team starts -->
<!-- to grow (or you have big amount of problems in same place of code and -->
<!-- everybody is focusing there) you start experiencing a lot of conflicts. This -->
<!-- is really hard with centralized VCS, since you haven't committed yet and any -->
<!-- mistake can turn out in lost code. -->
<!-- Also, post factum doesn't work that good anyway. Even if you do a code -->
<!-- review, you have some impedance to changing code, since "it already works, -->
<!-- this is not big deal, I'll change later". -->
<!-- And it is not that rare to have some sort of problem in development, in -->
<!-- half-finished state, when you suddenly need to put it aside in a patch to -->
<!-- hack on small fix since doing separate checkout takes ages. And managing -->
<!-- patches can be quite a burden. -->

Where to look    </h1>
</hgroup>
<p class="center">World has invented a great model for developer interaction:</p>
    <h2>
Open Source    </h2>
<!-- Not open source by itself, but rather development model, used by popular -->
<!-- projects. Popular in meaning 'big enough to attract strangers which want to -->
<!-- commit'. -->

<section class="slide">
<hgroup>
    <h1>
Open Source    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Core team (gatekeepers)</li>
<li>Contributors (developers)</li>
<li>Disconnected development</li>
</ul>
<!-- They basically have some kind of quality control to prevent bad code -->
<!-- appearing in repository. -->

    <h1>
Workflow    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Developers submit changes</li>
<li>Gatekeepers review them</li>
<li>Changes are merged in main line</li>
</ul>
<!-- So how does it work in the end? Developers submit changes in any way which is -->
<!-- suitable for you. With subversion projects this happened by using patches -->
<!-- sent by mail. -->
<!-- Then gatekeepers reply to mail or comment in code review tool. This really -->
<!-- needs to be disconnected from submitting code since you don't really want to -->
<!-- interrupt someone in a loop. Your developers could be gatekeepers for their -->
<!-- colleagues, actually. And it can be really annoying when somebody asks you to -->
<!-- review code when you are working on something else, of course. -->
<!-- When gatekeeper has no questions to code, code gets in your main repository -->
<!-- and everybody is happy. Sometimes. :) -->
<!-- You will end with a history which has much smaller amount of mistakes, -->
<!-- clearly wrong solutions and similar stuff. Hopefully. -->

What's the point    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Experience exchange</li>
<li>Prevent sad code</li>
<li>Collective code ownership</li>
</ul>
<!-- The idea is that new contributors have feedback loop with old contributors -->
<!-- (and gatekeepers) on how their code should be written. It works pretty the -->
<!-- same with developers - you could assign gatekeepering on developers who know -->
<!-- particular part of application better. -->
<!-- And of course we're all humans and occasionally can write something -->
<!-- mind-blowing. When you work on some part of the system for few hours in a row -->
<!-- you could write some awful code just to escape from there. Which is were -->
<!-- happy gatekeeper comes and asks you to remove sadness from code. -->
<!-- Also your team ends up with knowing different parts of code better since they -->
<!-- see it all the time -->
<!-- This workflow is simple enough to use it with any tools, starting even with -->
<!-- simple patches - that's how Linux kernel was developed for years. But this is -->
<!-- where distributed VCS really shine. -->
  </section>

<section class="slide">
<hgroup>
    <h1>
DVCS    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Changesets in repository instead of patches</li>
<li>Zero effort branching and merging</li>
<li>Full history of development</li>
<li>Total control of situation</li>
</ul>
<!-- If you have centralized VCS, to be able to gatekeeper changes, you'll have to -->
<!-- send them as patches. This case is much better with DVCS - you're going to -->
<!-- store them as commits in your local repository. With pushing and pulling all -->
<!-- the way around. Free backups, no more lost merges, happy life. :) -->
<!-- And your repository is local, so creating a branch doesn't involve any hassle -->
<!-- and nobody will notice until you want them to. Also, merge will work only -->
<!-- with new differences - changesets know their history and have context to -->
<!-- prevent conflicts of already merged changes. -->
<!-- And you never lose idea when exactly this bug was introduced, you still have -->
<!-- your changesets. Also, with local repository, you'll be happy to research -->
<!-- history since it's easy and fast. :) -->
<!-- You can easily pull changes in your repo and review how they affect overall -->
<!-- code, you can accept only certain changesets - because you have separate -->
<!-- commits and not a single patch, etcetera. -->

Mercurial    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Started in April 2005</li>
<li>Very fast</li>
<li>94% Python, 6% C (30k lines)</li>
<li>Simple and clean Python API for extensions</li>
</ul>
<!-- Mercurial started as response to Bitkeeper license withdrawn, same week as -->
<!-- git (this is an amusing story). -->
<!-- It's really fast, actually second fast on the market behind git maintaining -->
<!-- same order of magnitude of performance. Python introduces a bit of penalty -->
<!-- here. -->
<!-- It handles nice property of having highest feature/sloc ratio, which I think -->
<!-- is property of a project where people actually care about code. For -->
<!-- comparison, Bazaar has 85k lines of code and git 250k lines of code. Darcs is -->
<!-- also nice to mention, since it's 26k lines of code in Haskell. :) -->
<!-- And having nice API is really important thing, since in this case system will -->
<!-- have a lot of extensions. Which is the case with Mercurial, wiki page lists -->
<!-- more than hundred of 3rd-party extensions. -->

How it applies    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Track features with branches in a single repository</li>
<li>Have developers' repositories on a server</li>
<li>Tag branches with bookmarks (or use named branches)</li>
<li>Use all hg's power to help you</li>
</ul>
<!-- Main idea is that you implement every feature in separate branch. Each of -->
<!-- those branches starts at actual location where you need them. If we will look -->
<!-- on next slide, you can see that hotfix was done on a stable branch, while -->
<!-- features are being done on a default branch. -->
<!-- You track your branches with bookmarks or named branches, developers publish -->
<!-- their changes to their own repositories (not using central one in this case), -->
<!-- gatekeepers use this repositories to pull changes from. -->
